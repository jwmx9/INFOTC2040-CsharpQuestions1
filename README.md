### Q: What is a namespace?
- A namespace provides a way to keep one set of names separate from another. It is defined by the keyword namespace.

### Q: What are value types?
- There are two types of value types in C#. Structs and Enumerations. A struct type is a value type that is typically used to encapsulate small groups of related variables. Enumerations have a distinct type with a set name of constants called an enumerator list. When you assign a new value to a variable of a value type, that value is copied. Value types directly contain their data. 

### Q: What are reference types?
- With reference types, two variables can reference the same object; therefore, operations on one variable can affect the object referenced by the other variable. Reference types include class, interface, delegate, dynamic, object, and string.

### Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
- auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the property accessors. They also enable client code to create objects.

### Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
- The using statement obtains one or more resources, executes a statement, and then disposes of the resource.

### Q: What are dynamic type variables?
- A dynamic type is a static type. At compile time, an element that is typed as dynamic is assumed to support any operation.

### Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
- The is operator checks for type compatibility. It returns true if the operand can be cast to the type specified.
